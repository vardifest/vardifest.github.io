# Call for Papers

SAT 2022 welcomes scientific contributions addressing different aspects of the satisfiability problem, interpreted in a broad sense. Domains include MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints, Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), model counting, as well as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). Topics include, but are not restricted to:

- Theoretical advances (including algorithms, proof complexity, parameterized complexity, and other complexity issues);
- Practical search algorithms;
- Knowledge compilation;
- Implementation-level details of SAT solving tools and SAT-based systems;
- Problem encodings and reformulations;
- Applications (including both novel applications domains and improvements to existing approaches);
- Case studies and reports on insightful findings based on rigorous experimentation.

## Out of Scope

Papers claiming to resolve a major long-standing open theoretical question in Mathematics or Computer Science (such as those for which a Millennium Prize is offered), are outside the scope of the conference because there is insufficient time in the schedule to referee such papers; instead, such papers should be submitted to an appropriate technical journal.

## Style & Paper Categories

The submissions should be submitted in the form of a PDF file following [LIPIcs guidelines](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/styles/instructions/66). The site linked above has examples and the necessary style files. Please read the directions attentively as specific LaTeX packages are prohibited or restricted.

The review process of SAT 2022 is **single-blind**.  
Submissions to SAT 2022 are solicited in two paper categories, describing original contributions.

- Regular papers (up to 15 pages, excluding references and appendices)
- Tool papers (up to 8 pages, excluding references and appendices)

**NEW** There is no separate category of short papers. 

Regular papers should contain original research, with sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. For papers reporting experimental results, authors are strongly encouraged to make their data and implementations available with their submission. Submissions reporting on case studies are also encouraged, and should describe details, weaknesses, and strengths in sufficient depth.

Tool papers should describe the implemented tool and its novel features. Here “tools” are interpreted in a broad sense, including descriptions of implemented solvers, preprocessors, etc., as well as systems that exploit SAT solvers or their extensions for use in interesting problem domains. A demonstration is expected to accompany a tool presentation. Papers describing tools that have already been presented previously are expected to contain significant and clear enhancements to the tool.

## New Reviewing 

The review cycle will consist of two phases. The result of the first phase will be one of the following three decisions: 

- Accept: these papers will appear in the proceedings
- Reject: these papers will not appear in the proceedings
- Resubmit after revision: These papers are identified by the PC to have potential to be accepted upon resubmission that takes into account the feedback written by the reviewers. These papers will be invited for resubmission for the second phase. 

Subsequent to the reviewing in the second phase, the papers will receive one of the two decisions: accept or reject. 

This year the reviewing process will be structured. The review will have to start with a short summary of what the reviewer understood from the article, and then include explicit answers to questions such as: 

- What is the main claim / contribution of the submission?
- What is the quality of the writing ?  
- Are the experiments sufficient to support the claims in the article?

## Submissions

Submissions should not be under review elsewhere nor be submitted elsewhere while under review for SAT 2022, and should not consist of previously published material.

Submissions not consistent with the above guidelines may be returned without review.

Besides the paper itself, authors may submit a supplement consisting of one file in the format of a gzipped tarball (.tar.gz or .tgz) or a gzipped file (.gz) or a zip archive (.zip). Authors are encouraged to submit a supplement when it will help reviewers evaluate the paper. Supplements will be treated with the same degree of confidentiality as the paper itself. For example, the supplement might contain detailed proofs, examples, software, detailed experimental data, or other material related to the submission. Individual reviewers may or may not consult the supplementary material; the paper itself should be self-contained.

All papers submissions are done exclusively via EasyChair. The EasyChair submission webpage for SAT 2022 is:

<div style="background-color:#0055ff; text-align:center; border-radius: 25px; padding: 20px; width: 100%;">

[comment]: <> Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

One author of each accepted paper is expected to present it at the conference.

## Deadlines

- Abstract submission: February 21
- Paper submission: February 28
- Author response period: March 28 – April 1
- First notification: April 18
- Submission of Revised Papers: May 9
- Final Notification: May 30

# Call for Workshops

The International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability
Testing (SAT) is the premier annual meeting for researchers focusing on the
theory and applications of the propositional satisfiability problem, broadly
construed. In addition to plain propositional satisfiability, it also includes
Boolean optimization (such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints),
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and
Constraint Programming (CP) for problems with clear connections to Boolean-
level reasoning. SAT lies at the heart of the most important open problem in
complexity theory (P vs NP) and underlies many applications in, among other
examples, artificial intelligence, operations research, and electronic design
engineering.

We invite proposals for workshops affiliated with SAT. The purpose of the
workshops is to provide an informal venue in which participants can explore
specific research areas in-depth. In previous years, the workshop topics
included Pragmatics of SAT, QBF, Model Counting, SMT. Workshop proposals for
either these or new relevant topics are encouraged.

SAT 2022 will be part of the [FLoC 2022](http://www.floc2022.org/) — The 2022 Federated Logic Conference
July 31 – August 12, 2022 Haifa, Israel.

The instructions for submission of workshop proposals below are joint for all
the conferences participating in [FLoC 2022 workshop](https://floc2022.org/workshops/).


## Submission of Workshop Proposals

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for workshops on
topics in the field of computer science, related to logic in the broad sense.
Each workshop proposal must indicate one affiliated conference of FLoC 2022.

It is strongly suggested that prospective workshop organizers contact the
relevant conference workshop chair before submitting a proposal.

Each proposal should consist of the following two parts.

1. A short scientific justification of the proposed topic, its significance,
and the particular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a
list of previous or related workshops (if relevant).

2. An organizational part including:

  - contact information for the workshop organizers;
  - proposed affiliated conference;
  - estimate of the number of workshop participants (please note that small
  workshops, i.e., of less than ~13 participants, will likely be cancelled or
  merged);
  - proposed format and agenda (e.g. paper presentations, tutorials, demo
  sessions, etc.);
  - potential invited speakers (note that expenses of workshop invited speakers
  are not covered by FLoC);
  - procedures for selecting papers and participants;
  - plans for dissemination, if any (e.g. a journal special issue);
  - duration (which may vary from one day to two days);
  - preferred period (pre or post FLoC);
  - virtual/hybrid backup plans (including platform preference).



The FLoC Organizing Committee will determine the final list of accepted
workshops based on the recommendations from the Workshop Chairs of the hosting
conferences and availability of space and facilities.

Proposals should be submitted through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc2022workshops).

Please see the [Workshop Guidelines page](https://floc2022.org/workshops/) for
further details and FAQ.
